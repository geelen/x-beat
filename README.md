# <x-beat>

### A Web Component for generating a continuous stream of beats from (currently) MIDI and (soon) Web Audio for the synchronising of GIFs to music.

**SERIOUSLY WORK-IN-PROGRESS. REQUIRES ONE PARTICULAR DESKTOP BROWSER, A DEV FLAG & SOME EXTERNAL SOFTWARE TO GENERATE MIDI BEATS**

Now that's out of the way, the demos are here: http://geelen.github.io/x-beat/

The two biggest issues are here: https://github.com/geelen/x-beat/issues/1 for smoothing inputs and https://github.com/geelen/x-beat/issues/2 for replacing the MIDI dependency with Web Audio beat detection.
